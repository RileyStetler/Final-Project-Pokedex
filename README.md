Our project runs in Intellij Community Edition 2018

It uses jdk version 11.0.2 and Java Swing

We are also using gradle

In order to run the GUI faster, lower the # value on line 36 of the GUI: for (int i=0; i<#; i++)
Max limit should be 808, and lowest should be 2. We did not set anything, because ideally 808 would be the set number.
